## General

 *  Can I get NerfedButtons to do more than one thing per button press?

    NerfedButtons does LOTS of things 'between' each button press but will only ever use one ability/item/macro per key press. NerfedButtons is not an automation tool.

 *  Does this addon break the EULA?

    The addon utilises the addon API provided by Mythic and does not use any third party tools. Mythic have not indicated that they have any issues with the addon and when questioned, UI community representatived have indicated they are not aware of any concerns.

 *  I want NerfedButtons to do X!

    Either code a custom check or post a request to the discussion group.

 *  All the command-line stuff gives me a headache. Is there a GUI? 

    `/nb ui` will bring up the GUI :) You can also click the NerfeButtons icon
    situated below the minimap to bring up the GUI.
