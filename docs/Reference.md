# What is Shift-Clicking

NerfedButtons may be configured from the chat interface by passing commands
after the `/nb` prefix. Instead of typing all the characters of an ability
name, you MUST instead open up the Abilities Window (normally bound to the `V`
key) and hold down the shift key whilst clicking on an Ability Icon to add the
name of that ability to the `/nb` slash command.
 
Remember though... NerfedButtons now has a GUI! `/nb ui` will bring up the gui
:)
