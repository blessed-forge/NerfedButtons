NerfedButtons lets you define prioritised and conditional
ability/item/macro lis for your hotbar slots. NerfedButtons will
automatically ensure that the highest priority ability/item/macro that
passes its conditions is bound to the hotbar slot at any time.

 * Too many hotbuttons aggravating your RSI?
 * Want to stimulate your brain as well as your reflexes?
 * Are you a casual player who wants a chance against those 12 fingered mutants who play whack-a-mole with 4 full actionbars 24 hours a day?

NerfedButtons may be what you are looking for!

Disclaimer: Understanding NerfedButtons requires effort and the exercise of brain cells, you have been warned...
